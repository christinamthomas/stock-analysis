# Green Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
The client previously asked us to analyze a handful of green energy stocks in order to better invest and is now asking to expand the dataset to include the entire stock 
market over the last few years. While the original code works well for a few dozen stocks, it may take a long time to execute for thousands. In order to improve this we 
have refactored the code to loop through all of the data one time to collect the information and determine whether refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script
run faster.
## Results
Using knowledge of VBA and the starter code provided for the Challenge to refactor the script I looped through the data and collected all information. The refactored code
appears to now runs faster. See screenshots of code below.

## Summary
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Refactoring codes makes the code more efficient with fewer steps, leaving less room for error. It also helps reduce the run time of the Macros. However, refactoring codes
can be time consuming and may also lead to error and therefore altering the intended outcome.
### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The pros of refactoring this code was that it ran much quicker and more efficient as intended. However, the cons were that it left room for a lot of error. I made quite a 
few mistakes that required a lot of time to analyze and correct.
